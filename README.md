# Code samples of the CR4D project 
This repository showcases some Python codes I used for the CR4D project,
which I was working on in June to August 2020.

The codes are not well-documented but the methodologies for the computations are found in the following files
* [Wet and Dry Spells Methodology](https://github.com/tsinampoizina/CR4D_project/blob/master/Sophies_Work_Wet_and_Dry_spells.pdf)   
* [Wet Days Frequency Calculation Methodology](https://github.com/tsinampoizina/CR4D_project/blob/master/Sophie_Summary_wet_days_Frequency.pdf)  

Plot samples of the computed data are found in
* [Output Sample](https://github.com/tsinampoizina/CR4D_project/tree/master/output_sample)
