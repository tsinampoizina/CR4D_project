# Code samples of the CR4D project 
This repository showcases some Python codes I used for the CR4D project,
which I was working on in June to August 2020.

The input data for the codes are reanalysis data from the CORDEX-Africa and satelitte datas from other sources such as TRMM, CHIRPS. The raw data are transformed to produce wet/dry spells, total monthly rainfall, rainy days/heavy rain days frequency. The processed data are visualised as climatology maps, seasonal cycles, and interranual variability histograms.   

The codes are not well-documented but the methodologies for the computations are found in the following files
* [Wet and Dry Spells Methodology](https://github.com/tsinampoizina/CR4D_project/blob/master/Sophies_Work_Wet_and_Dry_spells.pdf).  
* [Wet Days Frequency Calculation Methodology](https://github.com/tsinampoizina/CR4D_project/blob/master/Sophie_Summary_wet_days_Frequency.pdf)  

Plot samples of the computed data are found in
* [Output Sample](https://github.com/tsinampoizina/CR4D_project/tree/master/output_sample)  

__The codes will work only if you replace the path of the project and the path of the data into your own path. I haven't factorised this process yet.__

## TODOS
* Refactor the prefix of file path of the project_folder and the data folder
